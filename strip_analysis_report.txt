M-138 CIPHER STRIPS ANALYSIS REPORT
===================================

SUMMARY
-------
Total strips analyzed: 100
Valid strips (26 unique letters A-Z): 3
Invalid strips: 97

VALID STRIPS
------------
Only 3 out of 100 strips contain all 26 letters without duplicates:
- Strip 1: AEJNRUYDHMPTVXZBCFGKLOQISW ✓
- Strip 2: BFLPSVZCEIMQTWYADGJKNORUXH ✓
- Strip 6: FJPSXZDGIMQUYBEHKNORTVACLW ✓

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. Most strips (97 out of 100) are INVALID

2. Common issues found:
   - Strips 3-25: Most have incorrect lengths (22-26 chars) with missing letters
   - Strips 26-50: Many contain duplicate letters and are missing several letters
   - Strips 51-100: Severe degradation with massive repetition of letters

3. Pattern observed:
   - Early strips (1-25): Closer to valid format, mostly 23-26 characters
   - Middle strips (26-50): Start showing more duplicates
   - Later strips (51-100): Extreme letter repetition, some letters repeated up to 7 times

EXAMPLES OF SEVERE ISSUES
------------------------
- Strip 81: Contains 5 copies of 'P' and missing 16 letters
- Strip 97: Contains 7 copies of 'F' and missing 18 letters
- Strip 98: Contains 6 copies of 'G' and 5 copies of 'F'
- Strip 99: Contains 6 copies of 'H' and missing 18 letters
- Strip 100: Contains 6 copies of 'I' and missing 18 letters

CONCLUSION
----------
The M138_STRIPS object in script.js contains mostly invalid cipher strips.
Only strips 1, 2, and 6 are properly formatted with all 26 unique letters.
The remaining 97 strips would not function correctly as cipher strips
due to missing letters and duplicates.

This appears to be either:
1. Test data with intentional variations
2. Corrupted data
3. A demonstration of different strip patterns

For a functioning M-138 cipher system, all strips should contain
exactly 26 unique letters (A-Z) in random order.
